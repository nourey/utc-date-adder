# Date Labeler
I was looking into the internet to find a script which adds current date and time in UTC format to given file and I couldn't find it.
This script is solving the problem. Just pass the path of the file and script will add date and time at the begining of the file.

If so, please raise your issiues if you have.
So we can learn better.
